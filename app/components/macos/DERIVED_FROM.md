# Derived Mapping

These components were extracted from a prior bundled macOS runtime snapshot.

- `window/window-controls.tsx`: derived from `037-pt.D.js`
- `finder/finder-list-view.tsx`: derived from `052-Ky.D.js`
- `finder/finder-header-controls.tsx`: derived from `057-cR.D.js`
- `finder/finder-sidebar.tsx`: derived from `063-bR.D.js`
- `finder/finder-window.tsx`: derived from `064-kR.D.js`
- `dock/dock.tsx` (grouping): derived from `090-HC.f.js`

This is a structural/component extraction, not a 1:1 functional rewrite of the full runtime.
